4. Rays, a simple camera, and background
Don't understand wtf any of this is.
really having a hard time wrapping my head around what a viewport is/
why it's needed?? Isn't it just a subgrid of sorts??
why do we say "a pixel is X fraction of a viewport unit" as opposed to
"a viewport unit is 20 pixels"?? So lost. Videos perhaps??
Hard to understand the math/calculations being implemented in code
when I don't understand the concepts behind it all.


Questions:
* What is a unit vector again?
* What is the std::ostream in write_color() in color.h?
    // todo ? why are we calculating width instead of height like with image dimensions?
